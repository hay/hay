* API's using Europeana content
* Users go to Google or Wikipedia, they're not likely to use any of our portals, nor are they likely to start with Europeana. We have to find ways of making sure we are in the users workflow.
* Reusable, open code
* We need to move into a position where we are providing more to the needs of the user, and where the user has started... 
* Make a seamless experience for the user, don't push content to users but accomodate them usign their own tools
* It moves away from a single destination site, to putting information where the user is.
* Users first!, content providers second.
* Trends:
    * Increased understanding that access to culture is the foundation or a creative economy. Thus, culture leads to creativity which leads to social innovation and to cultural and economic grwoth.
    * The aim is to have Europeana as a representation for Europe. Users have turned from passive consumers to active participants.
* What do users want?
    1. Europeana to them represents a trusted source
    2. Easy access
    3. Re-use
    4. In my workflow
